# General info
> M.E.V.N is a fullstack implementation in MongoDB, Expressjs, VueJS and Nodejs.

M.E.V.N stack is the idea of using Javascript/Node for fullstack web development.

*Most people use ReactJS (M.E.R.N) instead of VueJS, but I chose Vue, because why not?!*

# M.E.V.N Frontend
This is the Client-Side of the project M.E.V.N.
***You may find the Server-Side [here](https://github.com/AbdelFit/M.E.V.N-Backend.git).***

The project consists in giving the possibility to people to be able to first create an account and connect, and once they connect they can:
- create posts, modify or delete them
- see all posts and their comments
- add comments, modify or delete them
- see their own profile, all their posts and comments as well as modify their profile informations (username, bio, password)
- see other users' profiles as well as all their posts and comments
